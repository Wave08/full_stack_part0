## Notes Application Exercises
This repository contains exercises focused on developing a notes application, both as a traditional multi-page web app and as a single-page application (SPA). The main features include:

Creating Notes: Users can write and save notes using a text input field.
Displaying Notes: Notes are fetched from the server and displayed in a user-friendly format.
Dynamic Interaction: The SPA version allows for seamless interactions without page reloads, enhancing user experience.
## Diagrams
The documentation includes sequence diagrams illustrating the interactions between the user, browser, and server for both the traditional and SPA implementations:

Traditional Web App: Demonstrates the process of creating and displaying notes with page reloads.
Single-Page Application: Shows how notes can be created and updated dynamically without full page refreshes.
These exercises aim to provide a deeper understanding of web application architecture and the differences between traditional and single-page applications
